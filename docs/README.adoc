Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces CLI


== About CodeReady Workspaces

See product _Release Notes and Known Issues_ for more information about the product and the current version:

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_workspaces/2.0/html/release_notes_and_known_issues/


== Installing CodeReady Workspaces

See the CodeReady Workspaces _Administration Guide_ for instructions on how to deploy the product using various configurations and on different flavors of the OpenShift platform. The _Administration Guide_ includes instructions on how to:

* deploy with different parameters on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11
* deploy on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.x
* deploy on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated
* deploy on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in a restricted environment
* migrate from the previous version of the product
* uninstall the product

== Installing with OperatorHub

On Openshift 4.x, the recommended way to install Workspaces is via OperatorHub. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_workspaces/2.0/html-single/installation_guide/index#installing-codeready-workspaces-on-openshift-4-from-operatorhub_installing-codeready-workspaces-on-openshift-container-platform-4[Installing CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift 4 from OperatorHub].

However, the instructions below should also work, as crwctl is the recommended solution for installing Workspaces to an airgapped (restricted) environment, or for offline installs.

== Installing with crwctl

To install Workspaces 2.0 with crwctl:

* Download the latest crwctl from https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl/releases and install it
* using link:custom-resource.yaml[custom-resource.yaml] in this folder, deploy Workspaces as follows:

```
# log in to OCP 4 (or Minishift or CRC)
oc login ${OPENSHIFT_API_URL} -u ${OPENSHIFT_USERNAME} -p ${OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD} ...

# run deployment using default CRW images
/path/to/crwctl server:start -n crw2defaults
```

Note: if using Minishift, you might have to pre-pull images if your Minishift can't properly authenticate with the registry.

```
# pull images from registry.redhat.io as minishift cannot use authentication secret correctly 
eval $(minishift docker-env)
docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7:1-47
docker pull registry.redhat.io/redhat-sso-7/sso73-openshift:1.0-13.1567588155
...
```

== Overriding default images when deploying

If you need to swap out a default image for a custom one, eg., for testing a change, you can do so in three ways.


=== Override operator and default images

```
# run deployment using custom-resource.yaml to override Che defaults with CRW defaults
/path/to/crwctl server:deploy -n crw2custom \
  --che-operator-image=quay.io/crw/crw-2-rhel8-operator:latest \
  --che-operator-cr-yaml=custom-resource.yaml 
```

image:README.00_crwctl-cli.png[crwctl cli output]


=== Override CRW containers in the plugin registry

Once installed via crwctl, you can override the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-plugin-registry/v3/plugins/eclipse[default CRW containers referenced in the plugin registry] using these specific environment variables:

```
QP="quay.io/crw"
QS="rhel8:latest"
for e in \
  THEIA_IMAGE=${QP}/theia \
  THEIA_ENDPOINT_RUNTIME_BINARY_IMAGE=${QP}/theia-endpoint \
  MACHINE_EXEC_IMAGE=${QP}/machineexec; do
    oc set env deployment/plugin-registry CHE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_${e}-${QS};
done

# verify it worked
oc get deployment plugin-registry -o=json | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env'
```
image:README.01_plugin-reg-overrides.png[oc get output]


=== Override ALL containers in the plugin registry

Alternatively, you an override ALL images used by plugins using these global environment variables:

```
for e in \
  URL=quay.io \
  ORGANIZATION=crw \
  TAG=latest; do
    oc set env deployment/plugin-registry CHE_SIDECAR_CONTAINERS_REGISTRY_${e};
done

# verify it worked
oc get deployment plugin-registry -o=json | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env'
```

This override mechanism is also in support of airgapped environments, where the CRW images are provided from a different `URL` and/or `ORGANIZATION`.


=== Override CRW container(s) in a customized devfile

Next, to launch a workspace using custom stack or plugin sidecar images, you need to override the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles[default CRW containers referenced in the devfiles registry]. 

Here are two examples:

* Java - link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles/00_java-eap-maven/devfile.yaml[original] - link:devfiles/00_java-eap-maven/devfile.yaml[modified]
* Node - link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles/03_web-nodejs-simple/devfile.yaml[original] - link:devfiles/03_web-nodejs-simple/devfile.yaml[modified]

Once you have your devfile, you can open it in CRW using your installation's factory URL. Open your CodeReady Workspaces installation, and in place of the `/dashboard/` part of the URL, append `/f?url=` then the full *raw* URL of your devfile to load it.

`https://codeready-${OPENSHIFT_PROJECT}.${OPENSHIFT_INSTANCE}/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-deprecated/master/operator-installer/devfiles/00_java-eap-maven/devfile.yaml`

image:README.02_factory.png[factory loading screen]

Note: The factory page may not directly load your workspace. If that happens, just go back to your `/dashboard/` URL and you'll see your new workspace in the list of available ones. Click on it to start it up. 

image:README.03_workspaces.png[workspaces list]

Once your workspace loads, you should see something like this. You can run the sample app from the `Terminal` menu.

=== Override ALL containers in the devfile registry

Alternatively, you an override ALL images used by devfiles using these global environment variables:

```
for e in \
  URL=quay.io \
  ORGANIZATION=crw \
  TAG=latest; do
    oc set env deployment/devfile-registry CHE_DEVFILE_IMAGES_REGISTRY_${e};
done

# verify it worked
oc get deployment devfile-registry -o=json | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env'
```

This override mechanism is also in support of airgapped environments, where the CRW images are provided from a different `URL` and/or `ORGANIZATION`.
